	<div class="inner clearfix">
		<p>I was born in England, grew up in Auckland and have also lived in Wellington, London and Bonn, Germany. I love playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcXUD8sjd4Y" target="_blank">guitar</a>, singing and acting. In 2018 I joined Whitianga's Offbeat Theatre to act in my 5th play, and co-founded a local improv theatre group.</p>
		<p>Due to my interest in both maps and education, in 2016 I built <a href="http://schoolz.nz" target="_blank">this site with AngularJS</a> as an aid to house-hunting in New Zealand. My next venture is to become a skilled mobile app developer, I currently have two apps in development using React Native.</p>
